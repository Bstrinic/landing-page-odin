# Project Title: Landing Page

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a landing page based on a provided design specification. The page will contain four main sections and a footer, with a focus on implementing a clean, professional layout using HTML and CSS.

The goal of the project is to take a high-level design and break it down into smaller, manageable components. Each section of the landing page will be developed step-by-step, ensuring that the layout and structure are properly defined before focusing on styling and responsiveness.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to practice the following key web development concepts:
- Structuring HTML content into sections.
- Using CSS to style the page and ensure visual alignment with the provided design.
- Working with basic layout tools such as Flexbox to create a responsive layout.
- Gaining experience with writing clean, semantic HTML and CSS.
- Following best practices for committing and version control through GitHub.

## Design Reference
The design for this project is based on two reference images:
- **Image One (Full Design):** A complete view of the landing page, showcasing all sections and their layout.
- **Image Two (Color and Fonts):** A breakdown of the color scheme and font choices to ensure consistency with the design guidelines.

These images will guide the layout and aesthetic choices throughout the project. The goal is to replicate the look and feel of the design as closely as possible while maintaining a clean, structured codebase.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:
1. **Hero Section:** 
   - The first section at the top of the page, featuring large hero text and a call-to-action.
  
2. **Main Content Sections (3 Sections):** 
   - These sections will contain text, images, or other media, laid out in a manner that aligns with the design reference.

3. **Footer:**
   - A footer at the bottom of the page that typically contains contact information or copyright details.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** For structuring the content and organizing the sections of the page.
- **CSS:** For styling the layout, typography, and colors to match the provided design.
- **Flexbox:** To create flexible layouts and responsive designs.
- **Git & GitHub:** To track changes and collaborate on the project.

## Goals and Outcomes
The main objective of this project is to build a clean, professional landing page using modern HTML and CSS techniques. By the end of this project, the following outcomes should be achieved:
- A fully structured HTML page with defined sections.
- Proper use of CSS to replicate the visual design, including fonts, colors, and layout.
- A complete project hosted on GitHub, showcasing version control and project management skills.

## Key Learning Objectives
- Understanding the importance of HTML structure and CSS styling.
- Developing skills to break down a design into smaller components.
- Gaining hands-on experience with Flexbox for layout control.
- Using GitHub for version control and collaboration.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a foundation for understanding web development practices and building a fully functional static web page. By focusing on structure first, followed by styling, the project teaches valuable lessons about how to efficiently manage and develop a website from start to finish.
